# Proxmox Bug 6040 - Patch Documentation

This repository contains a functional demo, and a following discussion.

The intention is first to demonstrate, and only then to explain the context and the rationale for the [patch](https://lore.proxmox.com/pve-devel/mailman.80.1736016466.441.pve-devel@lists.proxmox.com/T/#u) I submitted, answering to bug 6040 which I reported [here](https://bugzilla.proxmox.com/show_bug.cgi?id=6040).

## Demo

The purpose of the demo is to demonstrate how exclude patterns work when extracting a `tar` archive in Debian-12 Linux (i.e. the root operating system of the Proxmox distro).

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository. I prefer to clone all of my reposories to `$HOME/repos`, which I am assuming below:
  
   ```bash
   cd
   git clone https://github.com/diraneyya/bug_proxmox_6040.git tar_extraction_demo
   cd tar_extraction_demo
   ```
  
1. After cloning the repository, type in the following commands in your local *nix-like system:
  
   ```bash
   tar tf file1.tar
   tar tf file2.tar
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > The `t` option stands for "Tree", which lists the file paths inside of the archive. The `f` option stands for "File", and allows the user to use a filename ending with `.tar` for finding the archive.
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > The two files, [file1.tar](./file1.tar) and [file2.tar](./file2.tar) contains the same files and directories. Yet, there is something different between the two, what is it?
   
1. Now is the time to spin up the demo using the [demo.sh](./demo.sh) script:
   
   ```bash
   cd ~/repos/tar_extraction_demo
   # run the script
   ./demo.sh
   ```

1. The script might take a bit of time to run, the first time you invoke it. It might also offer instructions on how to install missing utilities (such as `tree` or `tmux`) or exit if the `docker` command is not found on the local system. 
   
   > [!TIP]
   > Docker is used by the script to mimic the Debian-12 environment used by Proxmox when extracting archives using `(GNU tar) 1.34`.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Unlike `tree` and `tmux`, the script does not try to offer advice on how to install Docker.
   
1. After the demo is spun up, you will be able to see a horizontal pane at the top, for experimenting with different exclude patterns, and three vertical panes showing, in order:
   - The archive original contents. (left)
   - The extracted content when the supplied arguments are used to extract `file1.tar`. (middle)
   - The extracted content when the supplied arguments are used to extract `file2.tar`. (right)

   ![](./demo.png)

   > [!TIP]
   > Initially, the bottom middle and bottom right panes, are empty. This will change as you start running the extraction commands at the top pane. Note that with every extraction, the contents of the folders is wiped out, removing files from previous extractions. Hence, if the extraction command fails, then both directories become empty.

1. Now let us start by extracting both archives using no exclusion patterns what so ever:
   
   ```bash
   test_tar_extraction
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > The `test_tar_extraction` helper will take the arguments you supply to it and channel them to `tar` for the extraction of both archives.

   > [!TIP]
   > Can you make sense of what you see? Are you able to see the full `tar` command being used? is the extraction successful?

1. Now let us try to supply an empty exclusion pattern, as follows:
   
   ```bash
   test_tar_extraction --exclude
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > Can you make sense of what you see? Are you able to see the full `tar` command being used in this case? was the extraction successful?

1. Now, try the following exclude patterns, while taking the time to contemplate what you see, and what it means:
   
   ```bash
   test_tar_extraction --exclude *
   test_tar_extraction --exclude sample123
   test_tar_extraction --exclude ./sample123
   test_tar_extraction --exclude sample123/*
   test_tar_extraction --exclude ./sample123/*
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > Note that there is a root `sample123` folder, which is intended to match the root `dev` folder in a root filesystem archive. There is also another, nested `sample123`, which needs to be extracted, along with its contents.

1. Taking into account what you learnt above, now you are able to supply the exclude patterns needed to exclude the root `sample123` folder in **both** archives:
   
   ```bash
   test_tar_extraction --exclude sample123/* --exclude ./sample123/*
   # smarter alternative, which expands to the same
   test_tar_extraction --exclude={,./}sample123/*
   ```

> Now you are ready to proceed to the discussion! Just remember to exit the demo using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd>, followed by <kbd>D</kbd>, then type the following in the terminal:
> ```bash
> cd ~/repos/tar_extraction_demo
> # run the cleaning script
> ./demo.sh clean
> ```

## Discussion

There are many root filesystems published on the internet for virtualization purposes. Some of these are intended for virtual machines, and some of them, are intended for containerization.

Some of these root-filesystem tarballs contains paths that start with a _dot slash_ (like [file1.tar](./file1.tar)), while others, contain paths that start immediately (just like like [file1.tar](./file1.tar) in this repository).

Some of these root-filesystem tarballs, on the other hand, do not contain a root `dev` directory, some contain a populated one, while others, contain a non-populated one.

This matters because, tarballs that contain a populated root `dev` directory are not compatible with LXC containers, since an LXC container gets its root `dev` folder populated during its creation.

Hence, when the tarball contains a populated root `dev` directory, even though the rest of the root filesystem contents can be used as the basis of an LXC container, the container creation fails.

### Current Code

This [line](https://github.com/proxmox/pve-container/blob/85a1397d7254b0d9f042c0558578f4d5488e5446/src/PVE/LXC/Create.pm#L78) excludes a root `dev` directory from being extracted to the container's root filesystem during LXC container creation (from `pve-container.git`/`src/PVE/LXC/Create.pm`):
```perl
    push @$cmd, '--exclude' , './dev/*';
```

The only issue here, is that the code assumes that in this case, the root filesystem tarball would have paths starting with a _dot slash_ (similar to [file1.tar](./file1.tar)), rather than starting with themselves (similar to like [file2.tar](./file1.tar)).

### Inquiry

Below is a table showing different root filesystem images found on the internet, and whether they present the isse of a _populated root `dev`folder_, along with the type of paths inside of the archive:

To look for these images, I searched for "cloud images", which often included different formats for different virtualization technologies. As long as I was able to find a root-filesystem tarball files published, I considered the idea and the attempt to use these tarballs to create containers valid.

### Rationale for the Patch

> [!TIP]
> This section is edited by ChatGPT.

As virtualization evolves from VMs to containers, Proxmox users increasingly seek to adapt existing VM workloads for Linux containers. A critical step in this process involves obtaining a root filesystem archive that encapsulates the operating system's essential contents. These archives, however, vary significantly depending on their origins:

1. **Legacy Archives:** Derived from VM-oriented systems or live system images (e.g., squashfs archives).

- Tend to include fully populated root folders (e.g. `/dev`).
- Often omit a leading `./` prefix in file paths within the archive.

1. **Modern Archives:** Designed for containerization or specific containerization technologies (e.g., Docker).

- Typically contain minimal or empty root folders, including `/dev`.
- Consistently include a `./` prefix for paths inside the archive.

The disparity in archive structure and paths creates challenges in LXC container creation, particularly with populated `/dev` directories. LXC containers manage their own `/dev`, and a populated `/dev` in the archive leads to creation failure.

### The Current Situation

The existing Proxmox codebase addresses this by excluding the `/dev` directory during archive extraction. However, the current exclusion pattern (--exclude `./dev/*`) assumes that all archive paths begin with `./`. While this works for modern archives, it fails for legacy archives lacking the `./` prefix. Consequently, users attempting to repurpose such archives must manually repackage them â€”a labor-intensive and unnecessary process.

### The Proposed Modification

The proposition is either to change the exclusion pattern to `dev/*`, to accommodate the legacy archives in which this failure is more likely to occur, or, alternatively, to accommodate both archive types. By using a more general exclusion pattern (`--exclude={,./}dev/*`), Proxmox can seamlessly handle archives with or without the `./` prefix in their paths. This approach eliminates the need for repackaging and ensures compatibility with a broader range of root filesystem archives.
